# Sail Collision Fix
**Configurable options to bypass shipyard limits**

## Options
- Ignore sail collisions. (on by default)
  - Bypass the (SAILS COLLISION) warning. *this might be cheating*
- Ignore obstructions. (off by default)
  - Bypass the (OBSTRUCTED) warning. *this is probably cheating*
- Ignore sail angle limits. (off by default)
  - Allow all sails to rotate the full -89/89. *this is definitely cheating*

With all three options off, the mod does nothing.
With all three options on, if the sail fits on the mast and doesn't overlap with another sail *on the same mast* it can be installed and rotate the full -89/89
